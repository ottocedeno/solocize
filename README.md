# Solocize

Welcome to Solocize! An application where users can create and view quick 5 exercise workouts to do in a short period of time.

## Installation

The current verion of Solocize is in beta and can be cloned down to your local environment.

In terminal, type:

    $ git clone git@github.com:ottocedeno/solocize.git

## Usage

Run `bundle install` to install gem dependencies.

Run `shotgun` to start up a development server.

Note: Solocize's front end was designed as 'mobile-first'. For the best experience, open up the development link in Google Chrome, use the developer tools and emulate an iPhone X layout.

Solocize can do the following:

- Unique user log in. Users can create a profile to view existing workouts and create their own as well.
- Users can view any workouts by interacting with the front end application.
- Users can view all other users and see what workouts they've created.
- Also, users can create their own unique workouts from the existing exercise list.
- Finally, if a user wants to contribute exercises as well, they can do that via the create exercise form.
